## Overview
This project is a virtual reality experience created using Unity, featuring a meticulously designed Japanese-themed 3D environment. The goal was to craft an immersive experience optimized for the Oculus Quest VR headset, with interactive elements to engage users.

## What is Virtual Reality?
Virtual Reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can either mimic the real world or create an entirely new environment. Through VR technology, users can immerse themselves in a 3D space and interact with digital elements as if they were physically present. This is achieved using specialized hardware, such as VR headsets and controllers, which track users' movements and provide a sense of presence within the virtual world.
