## Overview
This project is a virtual reality experience created using Unity, featuring a meticulously designed Japanese-themed 3D environment. The goal was to craft an immersive experience optimized for the Oculus Quest VR headset, with interactive elements to engage users.

## What is Virtual Reality?
Virtual Reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can either mimic the real world or create an entirely new environment. Through VR technology, users can immerse themselves in a 3D space and interact with digital elements as if they were physically present. This is achieved using specialized hardware, such as VR headsets and controllers, which track users' movements and provide a sense of presence within the virtual world.

## Unity
Unity is a powerful and widely-used game development engine that allows creators to build interactive 2D and 3D experiences across various platforms. Known for its versatility and user-friendly interface, Unity is employed for developing video games, simulations, virtual reality (VR) environments, and augmented reality (AR) applications.

## Oculus Quest
The Oculus Quest is a standalone virtual reality (VR) headset developed by Oculus, a subsidiary of Meta (formerly Facebook). It offers a fully immersive VR experience without the need for external sensors or a connected PC, making it a popular choice for users seeking a high-quality, wireless VR experience.
